The present project has been conducted as part of PSY-3035 Programming and Data Visualization for Researchers. 

The project has investigated the use of my Spotify account during February-April 2024. I chose to use my Spotify-data from only a period of the year of 2024 due to the large amount of data. 

## Hypotheses
The following hypotheses were assessed:

H1: There are more female artists in my top 10 most played artists in February-April 2024 than male artists.

H2: At least one of my top 6 most played songs in February-April 2024 is by my most played artist.

H3: My most played artist remains constant across the three months. 

H4: I listen more to music in the morning than in the evening. 
## Data
The following information is provided in the dataset that I collected from my Spotify account:
- Name of song ('trackName')
- Artist name ('artistName')
- Date and time of day the song was played ('endTime')
- Length of song in milliseconds ('msPlayed')
